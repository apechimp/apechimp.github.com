Recently I broke the rear axle on my touring bike, and after inspecting the
hub, I noticed that the hub was missing chunks of metal and was riddled with
stress fractures, so I decided to replace the wheel. I bought [The Bicycle
Wheel](http://www.amazon.com/Bicycle-Wheel-3rd-Jobst-Brandt/dp/0960723668) last
Winter and I've been looking for a good excuse to build a wheel after reading
it, so I decided this was the perfect time to build a wheelset.

## Component Selection


### Front Wheel
- Hub: Shimano DH-3N80 (Dynohub)
- Spokes: 32 DT Alpine III 260 mm
- Rim: Weinmann Zac-19 26x1.5

### Rear Wheel
- Hub: Phil Wood FSA 7 speed Freewheel
- Spokes: 36 DT Alpine III 260 mm
- Rim: Weinmann Zac-19 26x1.5

I currently work at a bike shop and I get a great employee discount, so I
decided to go hog wild on the spokes and hubs. After seeing the somewhat scary
condition of my old hub after taking a long tour, I felt that getting the Phil
Wood hub was justified. Also, I do a fair bit of night riding, so I'm excited
to be able to ride at night and not worry about batteries being charged. The
spokes are marketed as some of the most durable, so hopefully that will be the
case since I intend to do some loaded touring and commuting on these wheels. I
cheaped out on the rims since I figured switching to a double walled rim would
be a significantly big upgrade. However, my mechanic friend pointed out
that the main disadvantage of lower end rims is that they are manufactured to
lower tolerances, so it is much more difficult to make a true wheel with very
low variances in spoke tension. Also, Mavic and higher-end rim producers
publish the maximum tension that a rim is capable of holding whereas with the
Chinese manufactured Weinmann rims, you just have to guess (or call the
manufacturer and ask, but unfortunately I do not speak Chinese).

Also, I think it is amazingly lucky that I was able to use the same size spokes
for both hubs. This made it so I could just buy a box of very nice spokes which
would not normally be stocked at a shop.

## The Build

With a box of spokes, a pair of rims, a pair of very nice hubs, a bottle of
triflow, a tube of anti-seize compound and *The Bicycle Wheel* at my side I
began to work. I used triflow to lubricate the nipple holes in the rims and
anti-seize to lubricate the threads. I chose to use anti-seize since I was
threading a steel alloy into an aluminum alloy (Alpine III spokes come with
alloy nipples). I more competent wheel builder would have used spoke prep, so
I'll have to try that next time.

I used a cross three lacing pattern for both wheels and just followed the
procedure in *The Bicycle Wheel* to do the lacing. The only revelation that
occurred here was that it is very important to give everything the same amount
of turns and to make sure that the nipples are seated after the hub is
rotated.

Truing and tensioning was a very long process. I think I had the wheels in a
truing stand for about 7 hours when it was all said and done. My routine for
tensioning was to true laterally and radially, check dishing, and increase
tension. I did this until I had a spoke that had the same tension as the
maximum tension for the wheel, then I prestressed the wheel using the method
outlined in *The Bicycle Wheel* and checked true. The problem with this method 
was that I never took any steps to ensure that the spokes had even tension, so
when I put the wheels on the first time, there was a catastrophic loss of
tension. I was talking with some mechanics and the owner of the shop I work at
about what I did wrong, and they convinced me that the wheels were probably
undertensioned and the tension had too high of a variance between the spokes,
so I retensioned the wheels but modified my method to make equalization of
spoke tension a priority. When correcting radial true, I looked for spokes that
had relatively low tension and tightened them in order to correct true. For
lateral truing, I looked for spokes that were relatively tight or loose to
correct the true and during the tensioning step, I tightened relatively loose
spokes more than the other spokes.

During this process, I finally appreciated why wheel building is sometimes
thought of as an art. When correcting true, it is not obvious which spoke
causes the wheel to go out of true. Sometimes, the spokes at the maximum
deviations from true are the culprits for pulling the wheel out of true, but
sometimes, there are spokes which are adjacent to the deviation which cause the
deviation and the spokes which are contained in the deviation are tensioned
properly. Finding these spokes is not easy (for me, even with the aid of a
tension meter), although I imagine the ability to find these spokes quickly and
reliably is an important trait of a good wheel builder.
